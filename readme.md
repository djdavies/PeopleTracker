# People Tracker, BSc FPY

* How much information can I find on an individual online using only their name, and a defined number of other bits i.e. school attended, current location, address?

* Uses the Google Search and Facebook Search with respective APIs - and manual scraping.

* Will build people profiles, based on search results from numerous sources.

* Determining what is correct data via human input, with further machine learning to train the automation of results determined correct.

* **Very much a work in progress!**
